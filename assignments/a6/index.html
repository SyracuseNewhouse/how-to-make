    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Use the simple game environment to create an interactive story.  This could be a choose-your-own adventure, a game of tic-tac-toe, or maybe you want to do some journalism where your users can ask questions!  The sky is the limit</p>
    <p>Start with the <a href="../../classes/games/game.zip">base "game" code</a> and fill in the "start" and "handleInput" functions to make your game. <em>(Due 4/24 by noon)</em><p>

    <p>To submit, email a link to your game, hosted on your server, to htmao-s14@googlegroups.com</p>
