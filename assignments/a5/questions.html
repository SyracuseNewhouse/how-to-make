<h1>A5: Logic Puzzles</h1>

<h2>Q1: Rock, Paper, Robots</h2>

<p>The robot uprising is about to begin, and the robot-leader-elect has placed the fate of humanity in your hands. &nbsp;She tells you that in the other room there are three boxes (“A” “B” “C”). &nbsp;Each box contains a piece of paper with a random number between 1 and 10 written on it.</p>

<p>In five minutes she will let you in that room, and says that she will shut down the entire robot army if you can rearrange the papers so that the numbers appear in ascending order (for instance, if the numbers were “5” “3” and “9” you would need to rearrange them to “3” “5” “9”)</p>

<p>Easy, right? &nbsp;Not so fast, says the robot. &nbsp;Before you go in, she is going to reprogram your brain so that you have to follow a “script” of your own design. &nbsp;Using only “If” statements, write a list of instructions for yourself that will guarantee that all numbers are in ascending order by the time you’re done.</p>

<h2>Q2: A Goldfish Simulator</h2>

<p>You want a pet goldfish, but you know that you won&#39;t remember to feed it. That&#39;s why you decided to just program a website that simulates a goldfish.</p>

<p>Your simulated goldfish is boring and stupid. It can only do three things:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Swim</li>
	<li>Eat</li>
	<li>&quot;Sleep&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>Your simulator features two buttons: Feed, and Tap. When the &quot;Feed&quot; button is pressed, your site will pepper your goldfish with digital food. When the &quot;Tap&quot; button is pressed, the goldfish will stop doing what it was doing and start doing something else (this is the ONLY way to get your goldfish to do something new). Specifically, one of three things will happen:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If your tank has no food in it, the goldfish will swim</li>
	<li>If your tank has food in it, and the goldfish was swimming, your goldfish will eat the food (note: this means the tank no longer has food in it, until the &quot;Feed&quot; button is pressed again)</li>
	<li>If your tank has food in it, and the goldfish was eating, your goldfish will get overwhelmed with food and &quot;go to sleep.&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>The moment you finish your goldfish simulator, you decide to take it for a spin! You start madly tapping the buttons, this is even better than flappy bird! Here&#39;s what you press:</p>

<p>Feed, Feed, Feed, Tap, Tap, Feed, Tap, Tap, Tap, Feed, Feed, Tap, Tap, Tap, Feed, Tap, Feed, Tap, Tap, Feed, Tap, Tap, Feed, Tap, Tap, Feed, Feed, Feed, Tap</p>

<p>But then you stop. At some point you realize that your goldfish &quot;fell asleep&quot; when you weren&#39;t paying attention. How many meals did your goldfish get to enjoy (how many times did the goldfish &quot;eat&quot;) before he decided to take a nap?</p>

<h2>Q3: A Book Worth 5 Letters</h2>

<p>You watch the old man slowly walk up to the librarian, holding an envelope of 5 letters cut out of old newspaper headlines. &quot;I have been afflicted with a terrible curse! You see, I can&#39;t spell any longer. The only way to break it is if you give me a list of all the books whose titles contain one of these letters.&quot;</p>

<p>The librarian doesn&#39;t have time to deal with this crap, but he sighs and says &quot;That doesn&#39;t really make sense.&quot; Luckily, he has access to a database containing all book titles in the library. Better yet, that database has an API which returns a list of all the library book titles as an array.</p>

<p>The librarian starts by writing two lines of code, but then collapses in a cursed heap. Thank goodness you are standing right there, ready to help! Here&#39;s what the late librarian wrote so far:</p>

<pre><code>var books = getListOfBookTitles();
var letters = [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;d&#39;,&#39;e&#39;];
</code></pre>

<p>Finish the quick script so that it will loop (or &quot;iterate&quot;) through the list of books and output any title that contains one of the entered letters. (You can just describe your code in step-by-step plain english)</p>

<h2>Q4: Spaced</h2>

<p>&quot;Today is going to be a great day!&quot; you say to yourself as you roll out of the pile of dirty clothes that has been your bed for the past month. You see, it&#39;s finally time to buy furniture for your apartment. You go to the store to buy a bed, a couch, a table, and a chair.</p>

<p>When you get there, the store owner is beaming. It looks like all his furniture has a new chrome sheen to it. It is all digital and futuristic. He tells you that this new furniture will install itself. You just have to define a few variables for each object. Specifically, where in your room you want to put it!</p>

<p>He takes out a laptop and hands it over. You see the following screen:</p>

<pre><code>chair.width = 1
chair.length = 1
chair.x = ?
chair.y = ?

bed.width = 2
bed.length = 4
bed.x = ?
bed.y = ?

couch.width = 3
couch.length = 1
couch.x = ?
couch.y = ?

table.width = 4
table.length = 4
table.x = ?
table.y = ?
</code></pre>

<p>The owner tells you that to buy your new furniture you have to say where in your room you want it placed. The upper left hand corner of your room is &quot;x: 0, y:0&quot; which means if you wanted your table there you would have to enter &quot;0&quot; for x and &quot;0&quot; for y. It would then fill slots 0, 1, 2, and 3 going up and going to the right.</p>

<p>Your room is an 8 by 8 grid, which means things are going to be pretty tight. Define the x and y values for your new furniture so that you have a layout where nothing overlaps!</p>
